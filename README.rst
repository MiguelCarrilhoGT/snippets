  completion and line editing
- ``CMakeLists.txt``: build instructions for all C and C++ sources
- ``conftool.py``: implements a command-line configuration editor using
  configobj
- ``dbus_glib_hal_signals.c``: demonstrates DBus signal handling using the
  dbus-glib bindings
- ``dbus_glib_hal_signals.py``: demonstrates DBus signal handling using the
  python-dbus (with glib as mainloop, which does however not really matter

  with proper padding
- ``qt4_checkable_filesystem_model.py``: ``QFileSystemModel``-derived model,
  which adds checkboxes to file names

  create a generic config editor based on the configspec feature of
  configobj
- ``qt4-countdown.py``: a simple PyQt4 countdown app
- ``qt4_dbus_trayicon.py``: combines Qt4 and python-dbus to create a
  remote-controllable, single-instance systray application
- ``qt4_frameless_fullscreen.py``: shows how to create windows without
  frames and in fullscreen mode using PyQt4
- ``qt4_painiting.py``: demonstrates the use of the Qt4 painting API to
  paint a rotating spiral
- ``qt4_icons_listview.py``: how to display icons in a QListView
- ``qt4_input_validation.py``: how to use QValidator subclasses for input
  validation
- ``qt4_phonon_audio.py``: using Phonon and PyQt4 to create a very simple
  audio player
- ``qt4_phonon_duplicate_video.py``: duplicate video streams to different
  playback widgets using PyQt4 and Phonon (requires GStreamer backend for
  Phonon at point of writing)
- ``qt4_phonon_video.py``: using Phonon and PyQt4 to create a very simple
  video player
- ``qt4_service_manager.py``: uses ``QDirModel`` to create a simple service
  manager for ``/etc/init.d`` scripts

  output using QProcess
- ``qt4_table_header_alignment.py``: how to align table headers in a
  QTableView
- ``qt4_table_resize.py``: a simple QTableView-derived class, which resizes
  columns automatically, if the view is resized

  facilities by implementing a very simple chat program
- ``qt4_thread_progress.py``: demonstrates how to report the progress of
  long-running background worker threads using QProgressBar and QThread
- ``qt4_toolbar_in_tabs.py``: how to use toolbars within a QTabWidget (using
  a bit of dirty trick)
- ``qt4_webkit_render_to_image.py``: render a website to an image file using
  PyQt4 and QtWebkit
- ``qt4_window_screenshot.py``: takes a screenshot of window client area and
  displays the screenshot
- ``qt4_xml_model.py``: demonstrates the powers of model classes in Qt4
- ``screenshot.py``: uses ``xwininfo`` and ``import`` to take screenshots
  based on window titles
- ``ssh_client.py``: demonstrates the use the paramiko API
- ``xmpp_muc_logger.py``: implements a logger for multiple Jabber MUCs
  using threading and xmpppy
- ``xmpp_muc_logger_unthreaded.py``: the same as above, but only for a
  single MUC, due to lack of threading

Use the following commands to build all C and C++ sources (make sure, that
all required libraries are installed!)::

   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
