Comparing languages and libraries
---------------------------------

This section contains snippets, which compare implementations of a certain
technique or algorithm in different languages and different libraries


DBus signal handling in C, C++ and Python using Gtk and Qt4
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``dbus_glib_hal_signals.c``
  DBus signal handling using the dbus-glib bindings

``dbus_qt4_hal_signals.cpp``

Usage instructions
------------------

The dependencies of the snippets are not explicitly documented.  Examine the
description and especially the source code of the snippets you are
interested in to find out, which dependencies must be installed for these
snippets.

If all dependencies are available, you can simply execute most snippets
using the corresponding interpreter.  However, C and C++ snippets need to be
compile first.  A cmake-based build system is provided for this task, just
run::

   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make

C and C++ snippets, whose dependencies are missing, are silently skipped.
If you are missing an executable for snippet, make sure, that really all
dependencies are installed.  Read the ``CMakeLists.txt``, if necessary.
